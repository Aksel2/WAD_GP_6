The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!"

    "message": "The moon landing is physically impossible to achieve given the supposed time constraints. Apparently Apollo 11 took 8 days and 3 hours to get to the moon. That’s 195 hours. The moon is 238,900 miles away from earth. So imagine the speed they needed to achieve to get to the moon in the first place. When I drive to San Diego from Las Vegas, it takes me about 5 hours. In those 5 hours I travel a total of 332 miles. That averages out to about 66.4 mph. But if I were to take a standard car and try to travel to the moon myself (a distance of 238,900 miles) it would take an incredible amount of time to get to the moon. Assuming I travel at 66.4 miles per hour to the moon from a car, it would take 3600 hours. 150 days. We didn’t have the fuel technology for a car to last that long in space. For us to reach the moon in a supposed “8 days and 3 hours” we’d have to travel 1225 mph. The fastest we’ve ever been able to reach in a car is in the 2005 Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 which only had a top speed of 253.81 mph. When you factor in air resistance it would take even longer to get there. Plus no car is capable of retaining oxygen for that long. When the astronauts would’ve got out of the spaceship, they’d die. Humans need oxygen to breathe. Plus I don’t even know how you would be able to get more fuel out there since they don’t have gas stations on the moon. An obvious fuel deficiency, inaccurate length of travel time, and the biological facts of humans makes the moon landing clearly impossible."
